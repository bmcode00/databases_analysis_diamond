Instruction

The entire analysis has been prepared for the Linux system (it does not work on Windows).

1. Download files and then run the script - db_analysis.py (this is the main script).
This can be done, for example, by moving the db_analysis.py script to the desktop and then using the command python3 ~/Desktop/db_analysis.py.

2. The program will run. Check if diamond, RStudio, and the required libraries are installed (option 1, if not, the program will install them).

3. During the first analysis, you should select the options one by one, as most of them require previous steps to function.

4. After checking diamond, RStudio, and libraries, create the folders (option 2) paste the sequence files downloaded from databases (filename: e.g., APD) into the Sequences_db subfolder.
Then, paste the functions (clean_fasta.py, convert_to_dmnd.py, run_diamond_comparison.py, DAIRId_IDAIRId.py, and visualize_rstudio.R) into the Function subfolder.

5. The option for calculating DAIRId and IDAIRId will be added in the near future.
